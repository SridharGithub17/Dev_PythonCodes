#Scopes
#4 nested scopes whose namespaces are directly accessible:
#the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names
#the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope, contains non-local, but also non-global names
#the next-to-last scope contains the current moduleâ€™s global names
#the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names
